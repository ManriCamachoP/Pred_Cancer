# Overview

# Code Implementation

### Load Libraries

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  # Data manipulation
  tidyverse,
  
  #Logistic Regression:
  magrittr, rio, here, caret, glmnet, performance, pROC, ROCR,
  
  # Other:
  ggthemes, scale
)
```

### Import the Data

```{r}
df = read.csv("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversidaddeCostaRica/GitHub/Predicción_Cancer/data/processed/data.csv")[,-c(1,2)]
head(df)
```

#### Transform to the correct datatypes

```{r}
df = df %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = vars(Race, Education, 
                         Coverage, GeneralHealth, 
                         Children, Depression,
                         Exercise, Smoker,
                         Mammo, Breast), 
            .funs = as.factor)

df$Breast = relevel(x = df$Breast, ref = "No Breast Cancer")
```

#### Adjusting the Logistic Model

```{r}
logistic_model = glm(data = df,
             formula = Breast ~ ., family = binomial)
```
